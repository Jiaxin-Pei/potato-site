            <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: June 15, 2024</p>

            <p>This Cookie Policy explains how Potato Annotator ("we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website or use our platform. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>

            <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
            <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>
            
            <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Potato Annotator) are called "first-party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>

            <h2>Why Do We Use Cookies?</h2>
            <p>We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our website and platform to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our website. Third parties serve cookies through our website for analytics and other purposes.</p>

            <h2>Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
            <p>The specific types of first- and third-party cookies served through our website and the purposes they perform are described below:</p>

                        <th>Purpose</th>
                        <th>Duration</th>

                    <tr>
                        <td>Essential/Necessary Cookies</td>
                        <td>These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our website and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the website, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our website functions.</td>
                        <td>Session to 2 years</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Performance/Analytics Cookies</td>
                        <td>These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous.</td>
                        <td>Session to 2 years</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Functionality Cookies</td>
                        <td>These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies, some or all of these services may not function properly.</td>
                        <td>Session to 2 years</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Targeting/Advertising Cookies</td>
                        <td>These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other sites. They do not directly store personal information but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device.</td>
                        <td>Session to 2 years</td>
                    </tr>

            <h2>How Can You Control Cookies?</h2>
            <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie preferences by clicking on the appropriate opt-out links provided in the cookie banner on our website.</p>
            
            <p>You can also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser to browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information.</p>

            <p>In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> or <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com" target="_blank">http://www.youronlinechoices.com</a>.</p>

            <h2>Do Not Track</h2>
            <p>Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Due to the different ways that browsers implement and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they are even aware of them. We currently do not respond to Do Not Track signals.</p>

            <h2>Changes to Our Cookie Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Please therefore revisit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.</p>
            
            <p>The date at the top of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.</p>
